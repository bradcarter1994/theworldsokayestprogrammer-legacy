This is mostly taken from Gayle McDowell's book _Cracking the Coding Interview_, which I highly recommend.


A lot of technical interviews follow a similar format. For a one hour, last-round interview, you can expect:
- Roughly 8 to 12 minutes of introductions and soft-skills questions
- 30 to 40 minutes of technical problem solving
- a 10 minute break for interviewers to go over their notes and make recommendations and for you to get a drink or use the restroom.

(For a 30 minute screener like you might get when a recruiter visits your university campus, it usually follows a 5-20-5 minute breakdown)

This is part 1 in a 3 part series about how to prepare for a technical interview.

In this post, we're going to go over the first of two types of technical problems that programmers usually see in job interviews: functional design problems.

Functional design problems ask a user to write some (pseudo)code to convert some inputs into some outputs or to perform elementary data structure operations. Examples include:
- "Can you write some code to check if a given string is a palindrome?"
- "Can you implement the insert function on this partially implemented linked list class?"
- "Given two strings, can you write some code to determine if those strings are anagrams of one another?"

I make my technical interviews interviews more predictable by developing a script that I can fill in along the way

Advantages of using a script include
1. You always know what to say next.
1. You won't forget any of your virtue-signaling buzzwords

My script goes like this:

1. Problem Specification
    1. Problem Definition in terms of inputs, outputs, and constraints
        1. Inputs
        1. Outputs
        1. Constraints
    1. Black Box Tests
1. Solution Implementation
    1. Best Case Big-O (Big Omega)
    1. Brute Force Solution
    1. Optimization
    1. Clean Up

Let's go through one of the above examples: Write some code to determine if two strings are anagrams.





The key is to practice. The time to start preparing for an interview is about a month before you have it.
