Hi,

My name is Brad and I software engineer at Microsoft Azure. Before that, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from Brigham Young University.

When I'm not at work, I like to rock climb and ski.

Most of my development skills are back-end and I'm writing and building this blog to gain more front-end and full-stack experience (and also because my overly-strong opinions deserve a bigger audience than they currently have). If you have tips for how I can make this blog look like it was written after 1995, please reach out.

You can contact me at:
